# Face-detection-CascadeClassifier

In this project we create the Machine Learning based project that detect your face in the vedio or the images we use 
haarcascade_frontalface_default
file to train the model and the model is create the rectangular box according to your face movement the box is 97% accurate 
we can increse the efficiency by using other detection model .


learn about numpy is impotant for image detection we should change image to the number in form of array
